    [width=\"100%\",cols=\"2,1m,7\",options=\"header\"]\n|=======================================================================\n\
    | Name | Java Type | Description\n| configuration | JmsConfiguration | To use\
    \ a shared JMS configuration\n| acceptMessagesWhileStopping | boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether the consumer accept messages while it is stopping. You may consider\
    \ enabling this option if you start and stop JMS routes at runtime while there\
    \ are still messages enqued on the queue. If this option is false and you stop\
    \ the JMS route then messages may be rejected and the JMS broker would have to\
    \ attempt redeliveries which yet again may be rejected and eventually the message\
    \ may be moved at a dead letter queue on the JMS broker. To avoid this its recommended\
    \ to enable this option.\n| allowReplyManagerQuickStop | boolean | Whether the\
    \ DefaultMessageListenerContainer used in the reply managers for request-reply\
    \ messaging allow the DefaultMessageListenerContainer.runningAllowed flag to quick\
    \ stop in case JmsConfigurationisAcceptMessagesWhileStopping is enabled and org.apache.camel.CamelContext\
    \ is currently being stopped. This quick stop ability is enabled by default in\
    \ the regular JMS consumers but to enable for reply managers you must enable this\
    \ flag.\n| acknowledgementMode | int | The JMS acknowledgement mode defined as\
    \ an Integer. Allows you to set vendor-specific extensions to the acknowledgment\
    \ mode. For the regular modes it is preferable to use the acknowledgementModeName\
    \ instead.\n| eagerLoadingOfProperties | boolean | Enables eager loading of JMS\
    \ properties as soon as a message is loaded which generally is inefficient as\
    \ the JMS properties may not be required but sometimes can catch early any issues\
    \ with the underlying JMS provider and the use of JMS properties\n| acknowledgementModeName\
    \ | String | The JMS acknowledgement name which is one of: SESSION_TRANSACTED\
    \ CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE\n| autoStartup | boolean\
    \ | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup.\n| cacheLevel\
    \ | int | Sets the cache level by ID for the underlying JMS resources. See cacheLevelName\
    \ option for more details.\n| cacheLevelName | String | Sets the cache level by\
    \ name for the underlying JMS resources. Possible values are: CACHE_AUTO CACHE_CONNECTION\
    \ CACHE_CONSUMER CACHE_NONE and CACHE_SESSION. The default setting is CACHE_AUTO.\
    \ See the Spring documentation and Transactions Cache Levels for more information.\n\
    | replyToCacheLevelName | String | Sets the cache level by name for the reply\
    \ consumer when doing request/reply over JMS. This option only applies when using\
    \ fixed reply queues (not temporary). Camel will by default use: CACHE_CONSUMER\
    \ for exclusive or shared w/ replyToSelectorName. And CACHE_SESSION for shared\
    \ without replyToSelectorName. Some JMS brokers such as IBM WebSphere may require\
    \ to set the replyToCacheLevelName=CACHE_NONE to work. Note: If using temporary\
    \ queues then CACHE_NONE is not allowed and you must use a higher value such as\
    \ CACHE_CONSUMER or CACHE_SESSION.\n| clientId | String | Sets the JMS client\
    \ ID to use. Note that this value if specified must be unique and can only be\
    \ used by a single JMS connection instance. It is typically only required for\
    \ durable topic subscriptions. If using Apache ActiveMQ you may prefer to use\
    \ Virtual Topics instead.\n| concurrentConsumers | int | Specifies the default\
    \ number of concurrent consumers when consuming from JMS (not for request/reply\
    \ over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling\
    \ up/down of threads. When doing request/reply over JMS then the option replyToConcurrentConsumers\
    \ is used to control number of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.\n\
    | replyToConcurrentConsumers | int | Specifies the default number of concurrent\
    \ consumers when doing request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask\
    \ option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads.\n| connectionFactory |\
    \ ConnectionFactory | Sets the default connection factory to be use\n| username\
    \ | String | Username to use with the ConnectionFactory. You can also configure\
    \ username/password directly on the ConnectionFactory.\n| password | String |\
    \ Password to use with the ConnectionFactory. You can also configure username/password\
    \ directly on the ConnectionFactory.\n| deliveryPersistent | boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether persistent delivery is used by default.\n| deliveryMode | Integer |\
    \ Specifies the delivery mode to be used. Possible values are Possibles values\
    \ are those defined by javax.jms.DeliveryMode. NON_PERSISTENT = 1 and PERSISTENT\
    \ = 2.\n| durableSubscriptionName | String | The durable subscriber name for specifying\
    \ durable topic subscriptions. The clientId option must be configured as well.\n\
    | exceptionListener | ExceptionListener | Specifies the JMS Exception Listener\
    \ that is to be notified of any underlying JMS exceptions.\n| errorHandler | ErrorHandler\
    \ | Specifies a org.springframework.util.ErrorHandler to be invoked in case of\
    \ any uncaught exceptions thrown while processing a Message. By default these\
    \ exceptions will be logged at the WARN level if no errorHandler has been configured.\
    \ You can configure logging level and whether stack traces should be logged using\
    \ errorHandlerLoggingLevel and errorHandlerLogStackTrace options. This makes it\
    \ much easier to configure than having to code a custom errorHandler.\n| errorHandlerLoggingLevel\
    \ | LoggingLevel | Allows to configure the default errorHandler logging level\
    \ for logging uncaught exceptions.\n| errorHandlerLogStackTrace | boolean | Allows\
    \ to control whether stacktraces should be logged or not by the default errorHandler.\n\
    | explicitQosEnabled | boolean | Set if the deliveryMode priority or timeToLive\
    \ qualities of service should be used when sending messages. This option is based\
    \ on Spring's JmsTemplate. The deliveryMode priority and timeToLive options are\
    \ applied to the current endpoint. This contrasts with the preserveMessageQos\
    \ option which operates at message granularity reading QoS properties exclusively\
    \ from the Camel In message headers.\n| exposeListenerSession | boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether the listener session should be exposed when consuming messages.\n| idleTaskExecutionLimit\
    \ | int | Specifies the limit for idle executions of a receive task not having\
    \ received any message within its execution. If this limit is reached the task\
    \ will shut down and leave receiving to other executing tasks (in the case of\
    \ dynamic scheduling; see the maxConcurrentConsumers setting). There is additional\
    \ doc available from Spring.\n| idleConsumerLimit | int | Specify the limit for\
    \ the number of consumers that are allowed to be idle at any given time.\n| maxConcurrentConsumers\
    \ | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when consuming\
    \ from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask option\
    \ to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply over\
    \ JMS then the option replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers is used to control number\
    \ of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.\n| replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers\
    \ | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when using request/reply\
    \ over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control dynamic scaling\
    \ up/down of threads.\n| replyOnTimeoutToMaxConcurrentConsumers | int | Specifies\
    \ the maximum number of concurrent consumers for continue routing when timeout\
    \ occurred when using request/reply over JMS.\n| maxMessagesPerTask | int | The\
    \ number of messages per task. -1 is unlimited. If you use a range for concurrent\
    \ consumers (eg min max) then this option can be used to set a value to eg 100\
    \ to control how fast the consumers will shrink when less work is required.\n\
    | messageConverter | MessageConverter | To use a custom Spring org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter\
    \ so you can be in control how to map to/from a javax.jms.Message.\n| mapJmsMessage\
    \ | boolean | Specifies whether Camel should auto map the received JMS message\
    \ to a suited payload type such as javax.jms.TextMessage to a String etc. See\
    \ section about how mapping works below for more details.\n| messageIdEnabled\
    \ | boolean | When sending specifies whether message IDs should be added.\n| messageTimestampEnabled\
    \ | boolean | Specifies whether timestamps should be enabled by default on sending\
    \ messages.\n| alwaysCopyMessage | boolean | If true Camel will always make a\
    \ JMS message copy of the message when it is passed to the producer for sending.\
    \ Copying the message is needed in some situations such as when a replyToDestinationSelectorName\
    \ is set (incidentally Camel will set the alwaysCopyMessage option to true if\
    \ a replyToDestinationSelectorName is set)\n| useMessageIDAsCorrelationID | boolean\
    \ | Specifies whether JMSMessageID should always be used as JMSCorrelationID for\
    \ InOut messages.\n| priority | int | Values greater than 1 specify the message\
    \ priority when sending (where 0 is the lowest priority and 9 is the highest).\
    \ The explicitQosEnabled option must also be enabled in order for this option\
    \ to have any effect.\n| pubSubNoLocal | boolean | Specifies whether to inhibit\
    \ the delivery of messages published by its own connection.\n| receiveTimeout\
    \ | long | The timeout for receiving messages (in milliseconds).\n| recoveryInterval\
    \ | long | Specifies the interval between recovery attempts i.e. when a connection\
    \ is being refreshed in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms that is 5 seconds.\n\
    | subscriptionDurable | boolean | Deprecated: Enabled by default if you specify\
    \ a durableSubscriptionName and a clientId.\n| taskExecutor | TaskExecutor | Allows\
    \ you to specify a custom task executor for consuming messages.\n| timeToLive\
    \ | long | When sending messages specifies the time-to-live of the message (in\
    \ milliseconds).\n| transacted | boolean | Specifies whether to use transacted\
    \ mode\n| lazyCreateTransactionManager | boolean | If true Camel will create a\
    \ JmsTransactionManager if there is no transactionManager injected when option\
    \ transacted=true.\n| transactionManager | PlatformTransactionManager | The Spring\
    \ transaction manager to use.\n| transactionName | String | The name of the transaction\
    \ to use.\n| transactionTimeout | int | The timeout value of the transaction (in\
    \ seconds) if using transacted mode.\n| testConnectionOnStartup | boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether to test the connection on startup. This ensures that when Camel starts\
    \ that all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. If a connection\
    \ cannot be granted then Camel throws an exception on startup. This ensures that\
    \ Camel is not started with failed connections. The JMS producers is tested as\
    \ well.\n| asyncStartListener | boolean | Whether to startup the JmsConsumer message\
    \ listener asynchronously when starting a route. For example if a JmsConsumer\
    \ cannot get a connection to a remote JMS broker then it may block while retrying\
    \ and/or failover. This will cause Camel to block while starting routes. By setting\
    \ this option to true you will let routes startup while the JmsConsumer connects\
    \ to the JMS broker using a dedicated thread in asynchronous mode. If this option\
    \ is used then beware that if the connection could not be established then an\
    \ exception is logged at WARN level and the consumer will not be able to receive\
    \ messages; You can then restart the route to retry.\n| asyncStopListener | boolean\
    \ | Whether to stop the JmsConsumer message listener asynchronously when stopping\
    \ a route.\n| forceSendOriginalMessage | boolean | When using mapJmsMessage=false\
    \ Camel will create a new JMS message to send to a new JMS destination if you\
    \ touch the headers (get or set) during the route. Set this option to true to\
    \ force Camel to send the original JMS message that was received.\n| requestTimeout\
    \ | long | The timeout for waiting for a reply when using the InOut Exchange Pattern\
    \ (in milliseconds). The default is 20 seconds. You can include the header CamelJmsRequestTimeout\
    \ to override this endpoint configured timeout value and thus have per message\
    \ individual timeout values. See also the requestTimeoutCheckerInterval option.\n\
    | requestTimeoutCheckerInterval | long | Configures how often Camel should check\
    \ for timed out Exchanges when doing request/reply over JMS. By default Camel\
    \ checks once per second. But if you must react faster when a timeout occurs then\
    \ you can lower this interval to check more frequently. The timeout is determined\
    \ by the option requestTimeout.\n| transferExchange | boolean | You can transfer\
    \ the exchange over the wire instead of just the body and headers. The following\
    \ fields are transferred: In body Out body Fault body In headers Out headers Fault\
    \ headers exchange properties exchange exception. This requires that the objects\
    \ are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects and log it\
    \ at WARN level. You must enable this option on both the producer and consumer\
    \ side so Camel knows the payloads is an Exchange and not a regular payload.\n\
    | transferException | boolean | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging\
    \ (InOut) and an Exchange failed on the consumer side then the caused Exception\
    \ will be send back in response as a javax.jms.ObjectMessage. If the client is\
    \ Camel the returned Exception is rethrown. This allows you to use Camel JMS as\
    \ a bridge in your routing - for example using persistent queues to enable robust\
    \ routing. Notice that if you also have transferExchange enabled this option takes\
    \ precedence. The caught exception is required to be serializable. The original\
    \ Exception on the consumer side can be wrapped in an outer exception such as\
    \ org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException when returned to the producer.\n| transferFault\
    \ | boolean | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and\
    \ an Exchange failed with a SOAP fault (not exception) on the consumer side then\
    \ the fault flag on link org.apache.camel.MessageisFault() will be send back in\
    \ the response as a JMS header with the key link JmsConstantsJMS_TRANSFER_FAULT.\
    \ If the client is Camel the returned fault flag will be set on the link org.apache.camel.MessagesetFault(boolean).\
    \ You may want to enable this when using Camel components that support faults\
    \ such as SOAP based such as cxf or spring-ws.\n| jmsOperations | JmsOperations\
    \ | Allows you to use your own implementation of the org.springframework.jms.core.JmsOperations\
    \ interface. Camel uses JmsTemplate as default. Can be used for testing purpose\
    \ but not used much as stated in the spring API docs.\n| destinationResolver |\
    \ DestinationResolver | A pluggable org.springframework.jms.support.destination.DestinationResolver\
    \ that allows you to use your own resolver (for example to lookup the real destination\
    \ in a JNDI registry).\n| replyToType | ReplyToType | Allows for explicitly specifying\
    \ which kind of strategy to use for replyTo queues when doing request/reply over\
    \ JMS. Possible values are: Temporary Shared or Exclusive. By default Camel will\
    \ use temporary queues. However if replyTo has been configured then Shared is\
    \ used by default. This option allows you to use exclusive queues instead of shared\
    \ ones. See Camel JMS documentation for more details and especially the notes\
    \ about the implications if running in a clustered environment and the fact that\
    \ Shared reply queues has lower performance than its alternatives Temporary and\
    \ Exclusive.\n| preserveMessageQos | boolean | Set to true if you want to send\
    \ message using the QoS settings specified on the message instead of the QoS settings\
    \ on the JMS endpoint. The following three headers are considered JMSPriority\
    \ JMSDeliveryMode and JMSExpiration. You can provide all or only some of them.\
    \ If not provided Camel will fall back to use the values from the endpoint instead.\
    \ So when using this option the headers override the values from the endpoint.\
    \ The explicitQosEnabled option by contrast will only use options set on the endpoint\
    \ and not values from the message header.\n| asyncConsumer | boolean | Whether\
    \ the JmsConsumer processes the Exchange asynchronously. If enabled then the JmsConsumer\
    \ may pickup the next message from the JMS queue while the previous message is\
    \ being processed asynchronously (by the Asynchronous Routing Engine). This means\
    \ that messages may be processed not 100 strictly in order. If disabled (as default)\
    \ then the Exchange is fully processed before the JmsConsumer will pickup the\
    \ next message from the JMS queue. Note if transacted has been enabled then asyncConsumer=true\
    \ does not run asynchronously as transaction must be executed synchronously (Camel\
    \ 3.0 may support async transactions).\n| allowNullBody | boolean | Whether to\
    \ allow sending messages with no body. If this option is false and the message\
    \ body is null then an JMSException is thrown.\n| includeSentJMSMessageID | boolean\
    \ | Only applicable when sending to JMS destination using InOnly (eg fire and\
    \ forget). Enabling this option will enrich the Camel Exchange with the actual\
    \ JMSMessageID that was used by the JMS client when the message was sent to the\
    \ JMS destination.\n| includeAllJMSXProperties | boolean | Whether to include\
    \ all JMSXxxx properties when mapping from JMS to Camel Message. Setting this\
    \ to true will include properties such as JMSXAppID and JMSXUserID etc. Note:\
    \ If you are using a custom headerFilterStrategy then this option does not apply.\n\
    | defaultTaskExecutorType | DefaultTaskExecutorType | Specifies what default TaskExecutor\
    \ type to use in the DefaultMessageListenerContainer for both consumer endpoints\
    \ and the ReplyTo consumer of producer endpoints. Possible values: SimpleAsync\
    \ (uses Spring's SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor) or ThreadPool (uses Spring's ThreadPoolTaskExecutor\
    \ with optimal values - cached threadpool-like). If not set it defaults to the\
    \ previous behaviour which uses a cached thread pool for consumer endpoints and\
    \ SimpleAsync for reply consumers. The use of ThreadPool is recommended to reduce\
    \ thread trash in elastic configurations with dynamically increasing and decreasing\
    \ concurrent consumers.\n| jmsKeyFormatStrategy | JmsKeyFormatStrategy | Pluggable\
    \ strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant with the\
    \ JMS specification. Camel provides two implementations out of the box: default\
    \ and passthrough. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens (.\
    \ and -). The passthrough strategy leaves the key as is. Can be used for JMS brokers\
    \ which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters. You can\
    \ provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy\
    \ and refer to it using the notation.\n| applicationContext | ApplicationContext\
    \ | Sets the Spring ApplicationContext to use\n| queueBrowseStrategy | QueueBrowseStrategy\
    \ | To use a custom QueueBrowseStrategy when browsing queues\n| headerFilterStrategy\
    \ | HeaderFilterStrategy | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header\
    \ to and from Camel message.\n| messageCreatedStrategy | MessageCreatedStrategy\
    \ | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy which are invoked when Camel creates\
    \ new instances of javax.jms.Message objects when Camel is sending a JMS message.\n\
    | waitForProvisionCorrelationToBeUpdatedCounter | int | Number of times to wait\
    \ for provisional correlation id to be updated to the actual correlation id when\
    \ doing request/reply over JMS and when the option useMessageIDAsCorrelationID\
    \ is enabled.\n| waitForProvisionCorrelationToBeUpdatedThreadSleepingTime | long\
    \ | Interval in millis to sleep each time while waiting for provisional correlation\
    \ id to be updated.\n|=======================================================================\n\

    | Name | Group | Default | Java Type | Description\n| destinationType | common\
    \ | queue | String | The kind of destination to use\n| destinationName | common\
    \ |  | String | *Required* Name of the queue or topic to use as destination\n\
    | clientId | common |  | String | Sets the JMS client ID to use. Note that this\
    \ value if specified must be unique and can only be used by a single JMS connection\
    \ instance. It is typically only required for durable topic subscriptions. If\
    \ using Apache ActiveMQ you may prefer to use Virtual Topics instead.\n| connectionFactory\
    \ | common |  | ConnectionFactory | The connection factory to be use. A connection\
    \ factory must be configured either on the component or endpoint.\n| disableReplyTo\
    \ | common | false | boolean | If true a producer will behave like a InOnly exchange\
    \ with the exception that JMSReplyTo header is sent out and not be suppressed\
    \ like in the case of InOnly. Like InOnly the producer will not wait for a reply.\
    \ A consumer with this flag will behave like InOnly. This feature can be used\
    \ to bridge InOut requests to another queue so that a route on the other queue\
    \ will send its response directly back to the original JMSReplyTo.\n| durableSubscriptionName\
    \ | common |  | String | The durable subscriber name for specifying durable topic\
    \ subscriptions. The clientId option must be configured as well.\n| jmsMessageType\
    \ | common |  | JmsMessageType | Allows you to force the use of a specific javax.jms.Message\
    \ implementation for sending JMS messages. Possible values are: Bytes Map Object\
    \ Stream Text. By default Camel would determine which JMS message type to use\
    \ from the In body type. This option allows you to specify it.\n| testConnectionOnStartup\
    \ | common | false | boolean | Specifies whether to test the connection on startup.\
    \ This ensures that when Camel starts that all the JMS consumers have a valid\
    \ connection to the JMS broker. If a connection cannot be granted then Camel throws\
    \ an exception on startup. This ensures that Camel is not started with failed\
    \ connections. The JMS producers is tested as well.\n| acknowledgementModeName\
    \ | consumer | AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE | String | The JMS acknowledgement name which\
    \ is one of: SESSION_TRANSACTED CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE\n\
    | asyncConsumer | consumer | false | boolean | Whether the JmsConsumer processes\
    \ the Exchange asynchronously. If enabled then the JmsConsumer may pickup the\
    \ next message from the JMS queue while the previous message is being processed\
    \ asynchronously (by the Asynchronous Routing Engine). This means that messages\
    \ may be processed not 100 strictly in order. If disabled (as default) then the\
    \ Exchange is fully processed before the JmsConsumer will pickup the next message\
    \ from the JMS queue. Note if transacted has been enabled then asyncConsumer=true\
    \ does not run asynchronously as transaction must be executed synchronously (Camel\
    \ 3.0 may support async transactions).\n| autoStartup | consumer | true | boolean\
    \ | Specifies whether the consumer container should auto-startup.\n| bridgeErrorHandler\
    \ | consumer | false | boolean | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel\
    \ routing Error Handler which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer\
    \ is trying to pickup incoming messages or the likes will now be processed as\
    \ a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer\
    \ will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions that\
    \ will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.\n| cacheLevelName | consumer\
    \ | CACHE_AUTO | String | Sets the cache level by name for the underlying JMS\
    \ resources. Possible values are: CACHE_AUTO CACHE_CONNECTION CACHE_CONSUMER CACHE_NONE\
    \ and CACHE_SESSION. The default setting is CACHE_AUTO. See the Spring documentation\
    \ and Transactions Cache Levels for more information.\n| concurrentConsumers |\
    \ consumer | 1 | int | Specifies the default number of concurrent consumers when\
    \ consuming from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask\
    \ option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply\
    \ over JMS then the option replyToConcurrentConsumers is used to control number\
    \ of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.\n| maxConcurrentConsumers\
    \ | consumer |  | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when\
    \ consuming from JMS (not for request/reply over JMS). See also the maxMessagesPerTask\
    \ option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads. When doing request/reply\
    \ over JMS then the option replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers is used to control number\
    \ of concurrent consumers on the reply message listener.\n| replyTo | consumer\
    \ |  | String | Provides an explicit ReplyTo destination which overrides any incoming\
    \ value of Message.getJMSReplyTo().\n| replyToDeliveryPersistent | consumer |\
    \ true | boolean | Specifies whether to use persistent delivery by default for\
    \ replies.\n| selector | consumer |  | String | Sets the JMS selector to use\n\
    | acceptMessagesWhileStopping | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether the consumer accept messages while it is stopping. You may consider\
    \ enabling this option if you start and stop JMS routes at runtime while there\
    \ are still messages enqued on the queue. If this option is false and you stop\
    \ the JMS route then messages may be rejected and the JMS broker would have to\
    \ attempt redeliveries which yet again may be rejected and eventually the message\
    \ may be moved at a dead letter queue on the JMS broker. To avoid this its recommended\
    \ to enable this option.\n| allowReplyManagerQuickStop | consumer (advanced) |\
    \ false | boolean | Whether the DefaultMessageListenerContainer used in the reply\
    \ managers for request-reply messaging allow the DefaultMessageListenerContainer.runningAllowed\
    \ flag to quick stop in case JmsConfigurationisAcceptMessagesWhileStopping is\
    \ enabled and org.apache.camel.CamelContext is currently being stopped. This quick\
    \ stop ability is enabled by default in the regular JMS consumers but to enable\
    \ for reply managers you must enable this flag.\n| consumerType | consumer (advanced)\
    \ | Default | ConsumerType | The consumer type to use which can be one of: Simple\
    \ Default or Custom. The consumer type determines which Spring JMS listener to\
    \ use. Default will use org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer\
    \ Simple will use org.springframework.jms.listener.SimpleMessageListenerContainer.\
    \ When Custom is specified the MessageListenerContainerFactory defined by the\
    \ messageListenerContainerFactory option will determine what org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer\
    \ to use.\n| defaultTaskExecutorType | consumer (advanced) |  | DefaultTaskExecutorType\
    \ | Specifies what default TaskExecutor type to use in the DefaultMessageListenerContainer\
    \ for both consumer endpoints and the ReplyTo consumer of producer endpoints.\
    \ Possible values: SimpleAsync (uses Spring's SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor) or ThreadPool\
    \ (uses Spring's ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with optimal values - cached threadpool-like).\
    \ If not set it defaults to the previous behaviour which uses a cached thread\
    \ pool for consumer endpoints and SimpleAsync for reply consumers. The use of\
    \ ThreadPool is recommended to reduce thread trash in elastic configurations with\
    \ dynamically increasing and decreasing concurrent consumers.\n| eagerLoadingOfProperties\
    \ | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Enables eager loading of JMS properties\
    \ as soon as a message is loaded which generally is inefficient as the JMS properties\
    \ may not be required but sometimes can catch early any issues with the underlying\
    \ JMS provider and the use of JMS properties\n| exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced)\
    \ |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice\
    \ if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use.\
    \ By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR\
    \ level and ignored.\n| exchangePattern | consumer (advanced) |  | ExchangePattern\
    \ | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.\n| exposeListenerSession\
    \ | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Specifies whether the listener session\
    \ should be exposed when consuming messages.\n| replyToSameDestinationAllowed\
    \ | consumer (advanced) | false | boolean | Whether a JMS consumer is allowed\
    \ to send a reply message to the same destination that the consumer is using to\
    \ consume from. This prevents an endless loop by consuming and sending back the\
    \ same message to itself.\n| deliveryMode | producer |  | Integer | Specifies\
    \ the delivery mode to be used. Possibles values are those defined by javax.jms.DeliveryMode.\
    \ NON_PERSISTENT = 1 and PERSISTENT = 2.\n| deliveryPersistent | producer | true\
    \ | boolean | Specifies whether persistent delivery is used by default.\n| explicitQosEnabled\
    \ | producer | false | Boolean | Set if the deliveryMode priority or timeToLive\
    \ qualities of service should be used when sending messages. This option is based\
    \ on Spring's JmsTemplate. The deliveryMode priority and timeToLive options are\
    \ applied to the current endpoint. This contrasts with the preserveMessageQos\
    \ option which operates at message granularity reading QoS properties exclusively\
    \ from the Camel In message headers.\n| preserveMessageQos | producer | false\
    \ | boolean | Set to true if you want to send message using the QoS settings specified\
    \ on the message instead of the QoS settings on the JMS endpoint. The following\
    \ three headers are considered JMSPriority JMSDeliveryMode and JMSExpiration.\
    \ You can provide all or only some of them. If not provided Camel will fall back\
    \ to use the values from the endpoint instead. So when using this option the headers\
    \ override the values from the endpoint. The explicitQosEnabled option by contrast\
    \ will only use options set on the endpoint and not values from the message header.\n\
    | priority | producer | 4 | int | Values greater than 1 specify the message priority\
    \ when sending (where 0 is the lowest priority and 9 is the highest). The explicitQosEnabled\
    \ option must also be enabled in order for this option to have any effect.\n|\
    \ replyToConcurrentConsumers | producer | 1 | int | Specifies the default number\
    \ of concurrent consumers when doing request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask\
    \ option to control dynamic scaling up/down of threads.\n| replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers\
    \ | producer |  | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers when\
    \ using request/reply over JMS. See also the maxMessagesPerTask option to control\
    \ dynamic scaling up/down of threads.\n| replyToOnTimeoutMaxConcurrentConsumers\
    \ | producer | 1 | int | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent consumers\
    \ for continue routing when timeout occurred when using request/reply over JMS.\n\
    | replyToOverride | producer |  | String | Provides an explicit ReplyTo destination\
    \ in the JMS message which overrides the setting of replyTo. It is useful if you\
    \ want to forward the message to a remote Queue and receive the reply message\
    \ from the ReplyTo destination.\n| replyToType | producer |  | ReplyToType | Allows\
    \ for explicitly specifying which kind of strategy to use for replyTo queues when\
    \ doing request/reply over JMS. Possible values are: Temporary Shared or Exclusive.\
    \ By default Camel will use temporary queues. However if replyTo has been configured\
    \ then Shared is used by default. This option allows you to use exclusive queues\
    \ instead of shared ones. See Camel JMS documentation for more details and especially\
    \ the notes about the implications if running in a clustered environment and the\
    \ fact that Shared reply queues has lower performance than its alternatives Temporary\
    \ and Exclusive.\n| requestTimeout | producer | 20000 | long | The timeout for\
    \ waiting for a reply when using the InOut Exchange Pattern (in milliseconds).\
    \ The default is 20 seconds. You can include the header CamelJmsRequestTimeout\
    \ to override this endpoint configured timeout value and thus have per message\
    \ individual timeout values. See also the requestTimeoutCheckerInterval option.\n\
    | timeToLive | producer | -1 | long | When sending messages specifies the time-to-live\
    \ of the message (in milliseconds).\n| allowNullBody | producer (advanced) | true\
    \ | boolean | Whether to allow sending messages with no body. If this option is\
    \ false and the message body is null then an JMSException is thrown.\n| alwaysCopyMessage\
    \ | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | If true Camel will always make a JMS\
    \ message copy of the message when it is passed to the producer for sending. Copying\
    \ the message is needed in some situations such as when a replyToDestinationSelectorName\
    \ is set (incidentally Camel will set the alwaysCopyMessage option to true if\
    \ a replyToDestinationSelectorName is set)\n| disableTimeToLive | producer (advanced)\
    \ | false | boolean | Use this option to force disabling time to live. For example\
    \ when you do request/reply over JMS then Camel will by default use the requestTimeout\
    \ value as time to live on the message being sent. The problem is that the sender\
    \ and receiver systems have to have their clocks synchronized so they are in sync.\
    \ This is not always so easy to archive. So you can use disableTimeToLive=true\
    \ to not set a time to live value on the sent message. Then the message will not\
    \ expire on the receiver system. See below in section About time to live for more\
    \ details.\n| forceSendOriginalMessage | producer (advanced) | false | boolean\
    \ | When using mapJmsMessage=false Camel will create a new JMS message to send\
    \ to a new JMS destination if you touch the headers (get or set) during the route.\
    \ Set this option to true to force Camel to send the original JMS message that\
    \ was received.\n| includeSentJMSMessageID | producer (advanced) | false | boolean\
    \ | Only applicable when sending to JMS destination using InOnly (eg fire and\
    \ forget). Enabling this option will enrich the Camel Exchange with the actual\
    \ JMSMessageID that was used by the JMS client when the message was sent to the\
    \ JMS destination.\n| replyToCacheLevelName | producer (advanced) |  | String\
    \ | Sets the cache level by name for the reply consumer when doing request/reply\
    \ over JMS. This option only applies when using fixed reply queues (not temporary).\
    \ Camel will by default use: CACHE_CONSUMER for exclusive or shared w/ replyToSelectorName.\
    \ And CACHE_SESSION for shared without replyToSelectorName. Some JMS brokers such\
    \ as IBM WebSphere may require to set the replyToCacheLevelName=CACHE_NONE to\
    \ work. Note: If using temporary queues then CACHE_NONE is not allowed and you\
    \ must use a higher value such as CACHE_CONSUMER or CACHE_SESSION.\n| replyToDestinationSelectorName\
    \ | producer (advanced) |  | String | Sets the JMS Selector using the fixed name\
    \ to be used so you can filter out your own replies from the others when using\
    \ a shared queue (that is if you are not using a temporary reply queue).\n| asyncStartListener\
    \ | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to startup the JmsConsumer message listener\
    \ asynchronously when starting a route. For example if a JmsConsumer cannot get\
    \ a connection to a remote JMS broker then it may block while retrying and/or\
    \ failover. This will cause Camel to block while starting routes. By setting this\
    \ option to true you will let routes startup while the JmsConsumer connects to\
    \ the JMS broker using a dedicated thread in asynchronous mode. If this option\
    \ is used then beware that if the connection could not be established then an\
    \ exception is logged at WARN level and the consumer will not be able to receive\
    \ messages; You can then restart the route to retry.\n| asyncStopListener | advanced\
    \ | false | boolean | Whether to stop the JmsConsumer message listener asynchronously\
    \ when stopping a route.\n| destinationResolver | advanced |  | DestinationResolver\
    \ | A pluggable org.springframework.jms.support.destination.DestinationResolver\
    \ that allows you to use your own resolver (for example to lookup the real destination\
    \ in a JNDI registry).\n| errorHandler | advanced |  | ErrorHandler | Specifies\
    \ a org.springframework.util.ErrorHandler to be invoked in case of any uncaught\
    \ exceptions thrown while processing a Message. By default these exceptions will\
    \ be logged at the WARN level if no errorHandler has been configured. You can\
    \ configure logging level and whether stack traces should be logged using errorHandlerLoggingLevel\
    \ and errorHandlerLogStackTrace options. This makes it much easier to configure\
    \ than having to code a custom errorHandler.\n| errorHandlerLoggingLevel | advanced\
    \ | WARN | LoggingLevel | Allows to configure the default errorHandler logging\
    \ level for logging uncaught exceptions.\n| errorHandlerLogStackTrace | advanced\
    \ | true | boolean | Allows to control whether stacktraces should be logged or\
    \ not by the default errorHandler.\n| exceptionListener | advanced |  | ExceptionListener\
    \ | Specifies the JMS Exception Listener that is to be notified of any underlying\
    \ JMS exceptions.\n| headerFilterStrategy | advanced |  | HeaderFilterStrategy\
    \ | To use a custom HeaderFilterStrategy to filter header to and from Camel message.\n\
    | idleConsumerLimit | advanced | 1 | int | Specify the limit for the number of\
    \ consumers that are allowed to be idle at any given time.\n| idleTaskExecutionLimit\
    \ | advanced | 1 | int | Specifies the limit for idle executions of a receive\
    \ task not having received any message within its execution. If this limit is\
    \ reached the task will shut down and leave receiving to other executing tasks\
    \ (in the case of dynamic scheduling; see the maxConcurrentConsumers setting).\
    \ There is additional doc available from Spring.\n| includeAllJMSXProperties |\
    \ advanced | false | boolean | Whether to include all JMSXxxx properties when\
    \ mapping from JMS to Camel Message. Setting this to true will include properties\
    \ such as JMSXAppID and JMSXUserID etc. Note: If you are using a custom headerFilterStrategy\
    \ then this option does not apply.\n| jmsKeyFormatStrategy | advanced |  | String\
    \ | Pluggable strategy for encoding and decoding JMS keys so they can be compliant\
    \ with the JMS specification. Camel provides two implementations out of the box:\
    \ default and passthrough. The default strategy will safely marshal dots and hyphens\
    \ (. and -). The passthrough strategy leaves the key as is. Can be used for JMS\
    \ brokers which do not care whether JMS header keys contain illegal characters.\
    \ You can provide your own implementation of the org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsKeyFormatStrategy\
    \ and refer to it using the notation.\n| mapJmsMessage | advanced | true | boolean\
    \ | Specifies whether Camel should auto map the received JMS message to a suited\
    \ payload type such as javax.jms.TextMessage to a String etc.\n| maxMessagesPerTask\
    \ | advanced | -1 | int | The number of messages per task. -1 is unlimited. If\
    \ you use a range for concurrent consumers (eg min max) then this option can be\
    \ used to set a value to eg 100 to control how fast the consumers will shrink\
    \ when less work is required.\n| messageConverter | advanced |  | MessageConverter\
    \ | To use a custom Spring org.springframework.jms.support.converter.MessageConverter\
    \ so you can be in control how to map to/from a javax.jms.Message.\n| messageCreatedStrategy\
    \ | advanced |  | MessageCreatedStrategy | To use the given MessageCreatedStrategy\
    \ which are invoked when Camel creates new instances of javax.jms.Message objects\
    \ when Camel is sending a JMS message.\n| messageIdEnabled | advanced | true |\
    \ boolean | When sending specifies whether message IDs should be added. This is\
    \ just an hint to the JMS broker.If the JMS provider accepts this hint these messages\
    \ must have the message ID set to null; if the provider ignores the hint the message\
    \ ID must be set to its normal unique value\n| messageListenerContainerFactory\
    \ | advanced |  | MessageListenerContainerFactory | Registry ID of the MessageListenerContainerFactory\
    \ used to determine what org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer\
    \ to use to consume messages. Setting this will automatically set consumerType\
    \ to Custom.\n| messageTimestampEnabled | advanced | true | boolean | Specifies\
    \ whether timestamps should be enabled by default on sending messages. This is\
    \ just an hint to the JMS broker.If the JMS provider accepts this hint these messages\
    \ must have the timestamp set to zero; if the provider ignores the hint the timestamp\
    \ must be set to its normal value\n| pubSubNoLocal | advanced | false | boolean\
    \ | Specifies whether to inhibit the delivery of messages published by its own\
    \ connection.\n| receiveTimeout | advanced | 1000 | long | The timeout for receiving\
    \ messages (in milliseconds).\n| recoveryInterval | advanced | 5000 | long | Specifies\
    \ the interval between recovery attempts i.e. when a connection is being refreshed\
    \ in milliseconds. The default is 5000 ms that is 5 seconds.\n| requestTimeoutCheckerInterval\
    \ | advanced | 1000 | long | Configures how often Camel should check for timed\
    \ out Exchanges when doing request/reply over JMS. By default Camel checks once\
    \ per second. But if you must react faster when a timeout occurs then you can\
    \ lower this interval to check more frequently. The timeout is determined by the\
    \ option requestTimeout.\n| synchronous | advanced | false | boolean | Sets whether\
    \ synchronous processing should be strictly used or Camel is allowed to use asynchronous\
    \ processing (if supported).\n| transferException | advanced | false | boolean\
    \ | If enabled and you are using Request Reply messaging (InOut) and an Exchange\
    \ failed on the consumer side then the caused Exception will be send back in response\
    \ as a javax.jms.ObjectMessage. If the client is Camel the returned Exception\
    \ is rethrown. This allows you to use Camel JMS as a bridge in your routing -\
    \ for example using persistent queues to enable robust routing. Notice that if\
    \ you also have transferExchange enabled this option takes precedence. The caught\
    \ exception is required to be serializable. The original Exception on the consumer\
    \ side can be wrapped in an outer exception such as org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException\

    \ Out headers Fault headers exchange properties exchange exception. This requires\
    \ that the objects are serializable. Camel will exclude any non-serializable objects\
    \ and log it at WARN level. You must enable this option on both the producer and\

    \nAs AMQP component is inherited from JMS component, the usage of the\nformer\
    \ is almost identical to the latter:\n\n*Using AMQP component*\n\n[source,java]\n\
    ------------------------------------\n// Consuming from AMQP queue\nfrom(\"amqp:queue:incoming\"\
    ).\n  to(...);\n\_\n// Sending message to the AMQP topic\nfrom(...).\n  to(\"\
    amqp:topic:notify\");\n------------------------------------\n\n[[AMQP-ConfiguringAMQPcomponent]]\n\
    Configuring AMQP component\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nStarting from the Camel\
    \ 2.16.1 you can also use the\n`AMQPComponent#amqp10Component(String connectionURI)`\
    \ factory method to\nreturn the AMQP 1.0 component with the pre-configured\_topic\
    \ prefix:\_\n\n*Creating AMQP 1.0 component*\n\n[source,java]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \ AMQPComponent amqp = AMQPComponent.amqp10Component(\"amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672\"\
    );\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nKeep in mind that starting from the\nCamel\_2.17\_the\_`AMQPComponent#amqp10Component(String\
    \ connectionURI)`\_factory\nmethod has been deprecated on the behalf of the\n\
    `AMQPComponent#amqpComponent(String connectionURI)`:\_\n\n*Creating AMQP 1.0 component*\n\
    \n[source,java]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    AMQPComponent amqp = AMQPComponent.amqpComponent(\"amqp://localhost:5672\");\n\
    \_\nAMQPComponent authorizedAmqp = AMQPComponent.amqpComponent(\"amqp://localhost:5672\"\
    , \"user\", \"password\");\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nStarting from Camel 2.17, in order to automatically configure the AMQP\ncomponent,\
    \ you can also add an instance\nof\_`org.apache.camel.component.amqp.AMQPConnectionDetails`\
    \ to the\nregistry. For example for Spring Boot you just have to define\_bean:\n\
    \n*AMQP connection details auto-configuration*\n\n[source,java]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    @Bean\nAMQPConnectionDetails amqpConnection() {\n  return new AMQPConnectionDetails(\"\
    amqp://localhost:5672\"); \n}\n\_\n@Bean\nAMQPConnectionDetails securedAmqpConnection()\
    \ {\n  return new AMQPConnectionDetails(\"amqp://lcoalhost:5672\", \"username\"\
    , \"password\"); \n}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nLikewise, you can also use CDI producer methods when using Camel-CDI\n\n*AMQP\
    \ connection details auto-configuration for CDI*\n\n[source,java]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    @Produces\nAMQPConnectionDetails amqpConnection() {\n  return new AMQPConnectionDetails(\"\
    amqp://localhost:5672\");\n}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\_\
    \n\nYou can also rely on the link:properties.html[Camel properties] to read\n\
    the AMQP connection details. Factory\nmethod\_`AMQPConnectionDetails.discoverAMQP()`\_\
    attempts to read Camel\nproperties in a Kubernetes-like convention, just as demonstrated\
    \ on the\nsnippet below:\n\n\_\n\n*AMQP connection details auto-configuration*\n\
    \n[source,java]\n-----------------------------------------------\nexport AMQP_SERVICE_HOST\
    \ = \"mybroker.com\"\nexport AMQP_SERVICE_PORT = \"6666\"\nexport AMQP_SERVICE_USERNAME\
    \ = \"username\"\nexport AMQP_SERVICE_PASSWORD = \"password\"\n\_\n...\n\_\n@Bean\n\
    AMQPConnectionDetails amqpConnection() {\n  return AMQPConnectionDetails.discoverAMQP();\
    \ \n}\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n[[AMQP-Usingtopics]]\n\
    Using topics\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo have using topics working with\_`camel-amqp`\_\
    you need to configure the\ncomponent to use\_`topic://`\_as topic prefix, as shown\
    \ below:\n\n[source,java]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \ <bean id=\"amqp\" class=\"org.apache.camel.component.amqp.AmqpComponent\">\n\
    \        <property name=\"connectionFactory\">\n          <bean class=\"org.apache.qpid.amqp_1_0.jms.impl.ConnectionFactoryImpl\"\
    \ factory-method=\"createFromURL\">\n            <constructor-arg index=\"0\"\
    \ type=\"java.lang.String\" value=\"amqp://localhost:5672\" />\n            <property\
    \ name=\"topicPrefix\" value=\"topic://\" />  <!-- only necessary when connecting\
    \ to ActiveMQ over AMQP 1.0 -->\n          </bean>\n        </property>\n </bean>\n\
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nKeep in mind that both\_\_`AMQPComponent#amqpComponent()`\_methods and\n`AMQPConnectionDetails`\
    \ pre-configure the component with the topic\nprefix, so you don't have to configure\
    \ it explicitly.\n\n[[AMQP-SeeAlso]]\nSee Also\n^^^^^^^^\n\n* link:configuring-camel.html[Configuring\
